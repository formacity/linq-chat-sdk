# linq-chat-sdk

A [Linq](https://linqapp.com) adapter for [Chat SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chat). It lets
Chat SDK applications receive and send iMessage, RCS, and SMS messages through an existing Linq
chat while retaining access to Linq-specific capabilities where the standard interface has no
faithful equivalent, including native mentions and conversation-scoped polls.

## Repository

- [`packages/adapter-linq`](packages/adapter-linq) contains the Forma-maintained adapter.
- [`apps/api`](apps/api) is an example Nitro application using Linq alongside other adapters.

`@forma/linq-chat-sdk-adapter` is a private workspace package for this fork. Linq's published
package remains `@linqapp/chat-sdk-adapter`; this repository does not publish under Linq's package
identity.

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @forma/linq-chat-sdk-adapter... install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check:adapter
```

`pnpm check:adapter` runs the canonical webhook event-name drift check, adapter lint, formatting,
tests, TypeScript contracts, and build. CI installs the full workspace and runs `pnpm check` on
Node.js 22.12 and 24, including the example application's typecheck and build.

Exact toolchain and dependency versions live in the [root manifest](package.json),
[adapter manifest](packages/adapter-linq/package.json), and [lockfile](pnpm-lock.yaml).
See the adapter [consumer README](packages/adapter-linq/README.md) for supported contracts and
[maintenance guide](packages/adapter-linq/MODERNIZATION.md) for toolchain policy and release checks.

## Maintenance

`main` is Forma's development branch. `upstream/main` is a read-only source for reviewed Linq
updates. Do not rewrite published history or rebuild existing release tags.
