# Linq adapter capability matrix

This inventory covers adapter-owned behavior, not every Linq endpoint. `Complete` means the local
implementation, public contract, deterministic tests, and durable documentation are complete.

Evidence labels:

- `Documented`: supported by current official Linq/Chat SDK contracts.
- `Contract-verified`: checked deterministically against installed types, fixtures, and integration
  contracts.
- `Provider-observed`, `Device-observed`, `Host-staged`: supplementary external evidence, never a
  universal completion gate.

## Standard Chat SDK surface

| Capability                        | Status   | Evidence and boundary                                                                                                                                  |

| Edit message                      | Complete | `Contract-verified`; current provider operation is text-only                                                                                           |
| Thread/history/message retrieval  | Complete | `Contract-verified`; untruthful rows omitted, full-precision stable chronology, cursors, bounded malformed-page traversal                              |

## Linq-specific surface

| Capability                                 | Status   | Evidence and boundary                                                                                                                         |

| Part-targeted replies/reactions            | Complete | `Contract-verified`; nested under `adapter.conversation()`; ordinary whole-message operations stay standard                                   |

## Verified webhook boundary

| Capability                                   | Status   | Evidence and boundary                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Atomic dedupe/callback isolation/`waitUntil` | Complete | `Contract-verified`; per-event listener snapshots and rejected callbacks do not delay acknowledgement                                                  |
| Missing current chat kind                    | Complete | `Contract-verified`; reuse a known fact or retain raw observation without lookup/guess/standard dispatch                                               |

## Cross-cutting boundaries

- Unknown reaction/sticker data and per-event `zero_retention` stay lossless; no inferred retention or contact workflow.
- Emit only `linq:{chatId}`; persisted `:dm/group` IDs are decode-only compatibility.
- Voice memos and `text/vcard` parts use standard secure downloadable media. The schema does not
  distinguish native voice memos reliably; transcription and contact handling are application-owned.
- Network defenses cover adapter-performed work; host HTTP/network policy and Linq upload-host
  integrity remain outside the adapter. Post-acceptance mutation failures are not retried or cleaned
  up as if rejection were certain.
- `Provider-observed` / `Device-observed` labels record supplementary historical evidence; no
  executable live harness is maintained.

## Intentional boundaries

| Item                                                                  | Disposition                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iMessage app messages                                                 | Application/provider-native; require an application-owned Messages extension and remain on `.client` / `getClient()` |
| Group, participant, and typing event state                            | Authenticated named/raw facts are available; no adapter-owned curated state model is currently justified             |
| Message deletion                                                      | Intentionally unsupported; Linq API deletion does not remove the recipient-visible message                           |
| Upload recovery, retention, databases, queues, polling, transcription | Application/host-owned                                                                                               |
| Account, subscription, administration, chat backgrounds               | Use native client; background enum discrepancy remains provider-owned                                                |
| AI-agent tools, prompts, authorization                                | Application-owned                                                                                                    |
| Delivery, retries, ordering, device presentation                      | Provider-owned                                                                                                       |

## Maintenance rule

Keep the adapter general-purpose. Add a public Linq-specific contract only when standard Chat SDK
cannot express the semantic, the official client alone is insufficient ergonomically, and durable
cross-application value is demonstrated. The canonical OpenAPI event enum is checked because it
backs a public type; provider-wide endpoint counts and examples are intentionally not tracked.
