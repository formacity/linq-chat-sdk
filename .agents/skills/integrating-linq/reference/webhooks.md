# Linq webhook checklist

Provider facts here were reverified on **2026-09-07**. Start with the current
[`docs.linqapp.com` index](https://docs.linqapp.com/llms.txt),
[webhook guide](https://docs.linqapp.com/channel/imessage/guides/webhooks/), and
[canonical OpenAPI](https://cdn.linqapp.com/openapi/linq-api-v3.yaml). Then inspect the resolved
`@linqapp/sdk` types and current repository tests. Record disagreements; do not resolve them from
this summary alone.

## Verification checklist

Always preserve the raw request body until authentication succeeds.

### Standard Webhooks — recommended

- Read `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, and `webhook-signature`.
- Verify `{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw_body}` using the subscription secret.
- Standard secrets use `whsec_` plus base64 key material; signatures contain `v1,{base64}` values.
- Reject timestamps outside five minutes and compare signatures in constant time.
- Use `standardwebhooks@1.1.1` directly. SDK `0.62.0` now has `webhooks.unwrap()`, but the
  adapter preserves its exact-byte, trusted-forwarding, and error contract independently.
- Reject empty decoded secrets. Parse JSON explicitly after authentication, including an empty
  body, and reject lossy UTF-8 decoding before signature verification.

Linq's current [Chat SDK integration page](https://docs.linqapp.com/channel/imessage/guides/integrations/chat-sdk/)
also describes an older `{timestamp}.{body}` HMAC shape. The primary webhook guide and Standard
Webhooks headers are authoritative for this adapter:
`{webhook-id}.{webhook-timestamp}.{raw_body}`. Do not copy the integration page's older signature
description into adapter verification.

The repository adapter accepts Standard Webhooks only. Deprecated `X-Webhook-*` signature handling
is outside its contract. Any partial Standard header set fails.

## Delivery checklist

- Deliveries are HTTP `POST` and at-least-once.
- Pin the target URL to `?version=2026-02-03` while that remains current.
- Return `2xx` quickly; the provider timeout is 10 seconds.
- Use host background-lifetime support such as `WebhookOptions.waitUntil` where applicable.
- Deduplicate using authenticated event identity and make callbacks idempotent.
- Linq retries `5xx`, `429`, connection timeout, and connection refusal up to 10 times over roughly
  25 minutes. Ordinary `4xx` responses except `429`, DNS failures, and invalid hosts are not retried.

## Current adapter ingress

`packages/adapter-linq` already implements signature verification, message/reaction parsing,
existing-chat sends, and two ingress forms:

- `chat.webhooks.linq(request, options?)` / adapter `handleWebhook()` is the ordinary one-step path:
  verify, normalize, dispatch supported standard events, and acknowledge.
- `adapter.verifyWebhook(request)` verifies and normalizes once without dispatch. Applications may
  inspect the authenticated observation before calling
  `adapter.dispatchVerifiedWebhook(webhook, options?)` for standard Chat SDK dispatch.

The typed path targets `2026-02-03` and preserves immutable parsed JSON, decoded request text, and
exact authenticated bytes as base64. It returns lossless `unsupported_version` observations for older, future, and unknown
non-empty versions. The ordinary path retains narrow compatibility dispatch for older signed
payloads and acknowledges future/unknown versions without current-schema dispatch. Verified
generic callbacks and atomic provider/partner/event deduplication are implemented through
`adapter.onLinqEvent(...)`. They are at-most-once attempted after claim; callback failures are
isolated and logged. Generic callbacks do not block acknowledgement. Pass the host's
`WebhookOptions.waitUntil` implementation so their completion survives the response; without it,
serverless completion is not guaranteed. Persistence and queue policy remain host/application
responsibilities.

Provider-produced compatibility evidence is event-triggered rather than a routine gate. Revisit it
when the signing verifier, `standardwebhooks` dependency, supported webhook version, Linq signing
contract, or a host's raw-body handling materially changes. Limit the assertion to real Standard
headers, the server-generated signature over the untouched body, the versioned envelope, and the
adapter's `2xx` response. It does not prove deduplication, callback timing, `waitUntil`, database
behavior, or provider delivery reliability. Historical real-delivery observations remain
`Provider-observed`.

The checked-in inventory records only the canonical event-name enum supporting the public typed
event contract. Run `pnpm openapi:check` to detect that schema drift. Installed
`@linqapp/sdk@0.62.0` includes unwrap and event types; generated wrappers are still not a
closed-world boundary. All 46 canonical names, including raw-only `contact_card.received`, are
checked against OpenAPI.

## Repository setup and storage

These current application entry points are separate from the reusable adapter package:

- `apps/api/server/api/linq/setup/webhook.post.ts` creates the minimal `message.received`
  subscription after setup authorization.
- `apps/api/server/lib/linq-api.ts` builds the version-pinned webhook URL and uses the official SDK.
- `apps/api/server/api/webhooks/linq.post.ts` clones the request for storage, invokes the ordinary
  Chat SDK webhook path, and stores successful verified deliveries using host `waitUntil` when
  available.
- `apps/api/server/lib/database.ts` stores the subscription secret/ID in application settings and
  raw deliveries in `linq_webhook_events`.

The setup route requires the application's Linq token and database configuration. Never place API
tokens, signing secrets, real participant identifiers, or environment-specific credentials in
tracked documentation or fixtures.

## Versioned envelope

The `2026-02-03` envelope includes `api_version`, `webhook_version`, `event_type`, `event_id`,
`created_at`, `trace_id`, `partner_id`, and event-specific `data`. Message events use
`MessageEventV2`: `direction`, `sender_handle`, nested `chat`, and top-level message fields such as
`id`, `parts`, `sent_at`, `delivered_at`, and `read_at`.

Before changing parsing, compare the official event guide/OpenAPI, installed SDK declarations,
`packages/adapter-linq/src/webhook.ts`, and current fixtures. Preserve provider facts that cannot be
normalized faithfully in the verified raw envelope.

## Mention and raw-fact boundaries

Inbound `mentions[]` is authoritative whenever present. Owner detection requires an exact owner
handle, `is_me: true`, and a valid UTF-16 range. Owner position and inbound formatting do not
exclude a mention. Only omitted modern fields use the deprecated singular fallback. Outbound
mentions stay singular. Contact-card events identify a line rather than a chat and receive only
named/raw dispatch. Unknown sticker/reaction details and `zero_retention` remain lossless;
applications own any contact, retention, or download workflow.
